# The_IoT_VirtualRobot

This is a simple example of the vitualization of a 6 axis robot arm, getting data from an ASP .NET api and a very basic Node-Red UI to control the axis positions.

## repository content:

- nodered-flow.json: the node-red flow to send data to the API
-- requires install of "node-red-dashboard" package

- IoTbotAPI: the .NET based API for HTTP get and post of axis position data

- 

- CAD_theDtechVirtualRobot.zip: CAD files of the robot (made in FreeCad software)
